Project Title: Tablet Rollout Scope Evaluation – Sauce & Spoon
Subject: Request for Support: Keeping Tablet Rollout Limited to Bar Area
Dear Alex,
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to reach out following our recent discussion about Omar’s request to expand the tablet rollout beyond the bar area. As you know, our original plan focused on the bar as a pilot zone to test functionality, user experience, and staff adoption before any wider implementation.

Based on our current progress and feedback, I believe expanding the rollout at this stage could introduce unnecessary risks. First, the training and configuration efforts required for a full dining room rollout would significantly increase costs and strain our existing resources. Second, without analyzing customer interaction data from the bar pilot, we may not have enough insight to ensure a successful broader implementation. Lastly, expanding too soon might create workflow confusion during peak hours and impact service quality — something we’ve all worked hard to improve.

Your operational insight and credibility with both Deanna and Omar would be invaluable in helping reinforce this perspective. If we can present a united front emphasizing data-driven decision-making and maintaining service standards, I’m confident they’ll see that keeping the rollout limited to the bar — for now — is in the restaurant’s best interest.
I’d appreciate your support in helping communicate this during our next stakeholder meeting. Please let me know if you’re on board — I’d love to align our approach beforehand.
Thank you for considering this, Alex. I truly value your partnership on this project and your commitment to ensuring Sauce & Spoon’s long-term success. 

Best regards, Peta Project Manager, Sauce & Spoon
